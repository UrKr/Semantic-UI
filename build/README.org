** Build multiple themes in one pass

By default, Semantic-UI use [[http://gulpjs.com/][gulp.js]] as its build tools. By default, gulp will
ask you several questions when called first time and store your answers to a
~semantic.json~ file. Next time you call ~gulp build-css~, it will execute
directly without asking you questions.

Semantic-UI use a ~theme.config~ file to configure different components for
different themes.

You can check the official [[http://learnsemantic.com/guide/expert.html#manual-install][documentation]] for a detailed guide about how to
customize Semantic-UI.

Here, we write a shell script to build multiple themes in one pass.

Basic workflow:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/semantic-ui-forest/Semantic-UI.git
cd Semantic-UI/build
cp semantic.json ..

# run a `npm install` and select "skip install" option.
cd ..
npm install
cd build

# It takes about 7 minutes to build about 20 themes.
bash -x build-all-themes.sh
#+END_SRC
